              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Risk assessments are typically conducted more frequently—often
                semi-annually or quarterly— allowing organizations to stay ahead
                of emerging cyber threats. This is especially important for
                rapidly growing businesses or those adopting new technologies
                that may introduce new vulnerabilities.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Their timing is proactive and forward-looking, aiming to
                identify and mitigate risks before they are exploited. This
                continual reassessment aligns with the dynamic nature of
                cybersecurity threats and evolving IT environments.

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                In contrast, security audits are generally performed on a
                structured and less frequent basis— typically annually, though
                some industries may require audits every three years. Frequency
                often depends on regulatory mandates, internal policies, and
                industry-specific standards.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Audits are retrospective in nature, focused on reviewing past
                performance and confirming compliance with security policies and
                controls. They are often scheduled around fiscal years or
                regulatory reporting deadlines.

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Regardless of regular schedules, both assessments and audits
                should be flexible. Events such as security breaches, major
                system changes, or organizational restructuring should trigger
                immediate reviews to reassess security posture.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Many organizations adopt a risk-based approach to scheduling,
                increasing assessment frequency for high-risk assets while
                maintaining a more routine cadence for lower-risk components.
                For example, a company may review its customer database
                quarterly but only audit internal systems annually.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Ultimately, finding the right balance in timing and
                frequency—based on business needs, available resources, and risk
                tolerance—is essential to maintaining a strong security posture
                without overextending your team.

            Prioritizing Risks for Mitigation

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Prioritizing risks for mitigation is a crucial step in the
                security risk assessment process, enabling organizations to
                allocate resources effectively and address the most critical
                threats first. This strategic approach involves evaluating
                identified risks based on their potential impact and likelihood
                of occurrence, then developing a structured plan for mitigation.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                One effective method for prioritizing risks is the use of a risk
                matrix, which visually represents risks based on their impact
                and probability. This tool allows organizations to categorize
                risks into high, medium, and low priority levels, facilitating
                quick decision-making and resource allocation.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                When prioritizing risks, it&apos;s essential to consider both
                quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative assessments
                might involve calculating a risk score by multiplying the
                potential financial impact by the probability of occurrence.
                Qualitative assessments consider reputational damage,
                operational disruption, and legal implications that are harder
                to quantify but equally important.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Organizations should also consider their risk appetite and
                tolerance levels—determining the level of risk they are willing
                to accept in pursuit of their objectives. Risks that exceed
                these thresholds should receive higher priority for mitigation.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Another critical consideration is <strong>risk velocity</strong>
                —the speed at which a risk can impact the organization.
                High-velocity risks that can escalate rapidly and cause
                significant damage should be prioritized over slower-moving
                risks.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Stakeholder engagement is also essential during prioritization.

              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">
                1. Exploratory Testing
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                One fundamental technique is exploratory testing, where testers
                investigate the application without predetermined test cases.
                This approach allows for creative problem-solving and often
                uncovers unexpected issues. Testers use their experience and
                intuition to explore different scenarios, simulating real-world
                usage patterns.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-[22px] text-base !leading-relaxed text-body-color md:text-lg">
                Equivalence partitioning is a systematic technique used to
                reduce the number of test cases while maintaining effective
                coverage. Testers divide input values into behaviorally related
                classes and select representative values from each class to
                ensure comprehensive testing.

                Boundary value analysis complements equivalence partitioning by
                focusing on the edges of equivalence classes. Testers examine
                values at the boundaries of valid and invalid partitions, as
                these are often prone to errors.
